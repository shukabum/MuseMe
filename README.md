## 🚀 About This Project  
We’ve all been there—**Googling the most random things at 3 AM**, from *"Can I legally fight a goose?"* to *"Why do I hear boss music?"* Instead of **deleting your search history in shame**, why not let it **analyze your mood and serve you a song that actually fits your vibe?**  

This **Chrome Extension** uses AI to analyze your **recent browsing history and typing patterns** to **detect your mood** and **play a song from Spotify** that matches your emotional state. No more **shuffle ruining your moment**—this extension knows exactly what you need!

## 🤔 Why Should You Use It?  
Because **deleting search history is boring**, but using it to realize:  
🔹 **Googling ‘Can I retire at 25?’** → You need motivation… and a reality check 💸  
🔹 **Frantically looking up ‘how to focus’** → You need Lo-Fi beats before procrastinating for 3 more hours 🎵  
🔹 **Searching ‘Do worms have feelings?’** → You need sleep, not music… but here’s some chill jazz anyway 💤🎷  
🔹 **Researching ‘Can I disappear without telling anyone?’** → You need sad songs and a GPS tracker 📍💀  
🔹 **Looking up ‘How to survive a bear attack?’** → You need calming music… and possibly a life coach 🐻😨  

Forget **Spotify shuffle ruining your mood**—this extension picks a song that **actually respects your emotional breakdowns.** 🎧
